Godot Starter Project
=== 
A Godot Starter Project with a lot of basic functionalities to speed up rapid prototyping, game jam- and, of course, game projects.

## Motivation
Every time when I'm participating on an GameJam I was starting a project from the scratch and always hacked down the basics like a menu, leaderboards and game state management last minute.
In this Git I want to setup a basic starter project with some essentials features from which can be derived easily.


## Planed Features
The following features are yet planed. Feel free to request more.
- Basic flexible game state handling
- Menu with most common options
- One or two UI themes
- Window management (upscaling, multiple resolutions)
- Local and global leadboard system (Godot 3.1+ when more mbedTLS are exposed)
- Supporting 2D and 3D games
